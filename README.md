# Scoville UI

Scoville UI builds and audits interfaces with the project's framework and
design system. It covers clear wording, useful hierarchy, responsive layouts
and accessible interactions, then checks the rendered result. A tidy component
tree is a start. People still have to use the page.

It includes specific guidance for plugin-owned WordPress admin pages, using
Core components and WordPress conventions.

Scoville measures chili heat. UI aims for a sharper interface without making
the user sweat.

## How it works

- Establish the user's task, approved design direction and framework components.
- Build the affected views, wording, states and responsive behavior.
- Inspect the rendered interface and try its relevant interactions.
- Apply the WordPress adapter to supported plugin-owned admin pages. Editor
  surfaces and metaboxes keep their host's conventions.

## What it enforces

- **A coherent interface.** Hierarchy, controls and terminology follow the task
  and the existing design system.
- **Usable states.** Loading, empty, error and success states receive the same
  attention as the convenient example with perfect data.
- **Access across devices.** Check responsive layout, zoom, reading order,
  contrast, focus and keyboard or touch operation where applicable.
- **Rendered proof.** Source checks alone cannot establish that the interface
  works. Unchecked rendering or interaction stays explicitly unverified.

See the [full instructions](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-ui/blob/main/scoville-ui/SKILL.md).

## What it costs

- Rendered inspection and interaction checks take tokens and time. They catch problems the source alone cannot show. WordPress tasks also load platform guidance.

## How it was developed

General interface work and WordPress admin tasks shaped the shared checks.
Rendered inspection exposed problems that source review missed. Neither type
of check replaces usability testing with the people who will use the product.

## Compatibility

Developed for Codex and Claude Code with the project's toolchain and browser or platform access for rendered checks and interactions. Fable, Astra, SOL or Opus (5.0+) are recommended. Luna 6 with High reasoning passed the selected comprehension and functional checks in Codex. Other routes and hosts remain unverified.

## Install

This Skill works independently. Other Scoville Skills are optional.

### Install this Skill

Ask your agent host:

```text
Install this Skill for all my projects from this exact package directory:
https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-ui/tree/main/scoville-ui
Preserve personal settings and unrelated Skills. Report the installed location
and whether the host discovers the Skill.
```

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. The
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) and the
[Claude Code Skills guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
list the locations for each host.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

The complete suite is in the
[Scoville Suite monorepo](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite).
Install its released Skill packages, not development templates.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville UI to implement this settings screen with the existing component system. Cover its states and verify the rendered interactions.
```

```text
Audit the checkout interface for keyboard use, responsive behavior, accessibility and error recovery. Report findings without changing files.
```

### Checking the interface

Use the styling options the component supports. If custom CSS is needed,
explain why. Keep CSS values and the sizes actually rendered on screen apart.

Make related edits together, then check the code and the rendered result,
including spacing and alignment. If defects remain, collect the corrections
and recheck the affected behavior once that batch is done.

A consistency audit lists regions, variants and states, including content
below the fold. Each finding points to the source, measurements and visual
evidence, or explains what couldn't be checked. Look at alignment, text,
whitespace, the inside of controls, icons, wrapping and clipping, and say
which parts of the interface were checked.

The vendor guidance shaped the general rules, but platform-specific layouts,
measurements, control behavior and visual conventions aren't universal
requirements. The working rules are in the Skill itself. These sources show
where they come from, so routine UI changes don't need web research.
Rechecking the composition after elements change is how the Skill applies
these principles.
